//! Re-probe a commit that this process died in the middle of (#370).
//!
//! `commit_operation` persists the caller's attribution — including
//! `request_id` — immediately *before* the commit RPC is sent, and
//! `format_attribution` puts that same id into the Junos commit comment as
//! `request.id=<uuid>`. So a process that dies between sending the commit and
//! recording its result leaves behind a record naming something the device can
//! be asked about.
//!
//! `ChangesetCoordinator::load` rewrites every non-terminal operation to
//! `Indeterminate` on restart, so that — not `Committing` — is the state a
//! crashed commit is found in. Pairing it with a present `attribution` is what
//! makes the selection precise: attribution is written nowhere else, so a
//! record carrying one had reached the commit, while a crash during staging
//! leaves `Indeterminate` with none.
//!
//! The rule that matters most here is what a *miss* means. Junos keeps a
//! bounded commit history, so an entry can age out; a device can also be
//! unreachable at startup. Neither is evidence the commit did not happen, and
//! settling such a record would assert an outcome nobody observed. Only a hit
//! settles anything.
//!
//! A confirmed commit is the other thing a hit cannot settle. Finding the id
//! proves the provisional commit entered the log, not that the rollback timer
//! was ever cancelled — so those are reported separately and left alone. The
//! entry's header is what tells them apart, which is why the match groups the
//! log back into entries rather than searching it flat.
//!
//! Known gap: a settle here writes the record directly and does not emit an
//! SSDF `result_receipt`, so a crash after the apply intent was spooled leaves
//! that evidence chain unterminated even once the device has confirmed the
//! outcome. Recovery is otherwise fully audited; closing the evidence chain
//! needs the recorder plumbed through startup and is tracked separately.
